# WhatWine Native Prototype

This is just UI prototype, completely ignoring business logic. Currently only developed and tested on Android. It's using some Android specific native components, so in case you want to run it on iOS, you have to replace those components with some iOS equivalents.

To build and run this app, you need to install [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html), for development on Android you need to have Android SDK and Java installed: [check docs on React Native site](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/android-setup.html).

There are [few gotchas](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/linux-windows-support.html) on Windows and Linux.
